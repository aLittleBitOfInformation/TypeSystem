# TypeSystem

C# is a strongly-typed language. Every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. Every method signature specifies a type for each input parameter and for the return value. The .NET class library defines a set of built-in numeric types as well as more complex types that represent a wide variety of logical constructs, such as the file system, network connections, collections and arrays of objects, and dates. A typical C# program uses types from the class library as well as user-defined types that model the concepts that are specific to the program's problem domain.</br>
The information stored in a type can include the following:</br>

•	The storage space that a variable of the type requires. </br>
•	The maximum and minimum values that it can represent.</br>
•	The members (methods, fields, events, and so on) that it contains.</br>
•	The base type it inherits from.</br>
•	The location where the memory for variables will be allocated at run time.</br>
•	The kinds of operations that are permitted.</br>

The compiler uses type information to make sure that all operations that are performed in your code are type safe.
